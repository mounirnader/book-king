           War and revolution have left the world unrecognisable. Great Britain, now known as Airstrip One, is ruled by the Party, led by Big Brother. Mass surveillance is everything and The Thought Police ensure no individual thinking is allowed. Winston Smith works at The Ministry of Truth, carefully rewriting history.

                There were three things Liv never wanted to be; starving, filthy, and alone. When an unexpected and inexplicable black out thrusts the world into chaos, that’s exactly how she finds herself. Running for her life, Liv falls at the feet of an unwilling savior. With a shack, a farm, and a lifetime of survival skills, Joshua is the perfect companion for the apocalypse. If only he wanted companionship.
                It’s hard to earn his trust and even harder to keep it. At a glance he seems to be nothing more than an off-kilter backwoods prepper with a grudge against humanity, but the longer she looks, the more Liv begins to see the man behind the churlish words and unkempt beard.

                The Color Purple by ALICE WALKER

                A powerful cultural touchstone of modern American literature, The Color Purple depicts the lives of African American women in early twentieth-century rural Georgia. Separated as girls, sisters Celie and Nettie sustain their loyalty to and hope in each other across time, distance and silence. Through a series of letters spanning twenty years, first from Celie to God, then the sisters to each other despite the unknown, the novel draws readers into its rich and memorable portrayals of Celie, Nettie, Shug Avery and Sofia and their experience. The Color Purple broke the silence around domestic and sexual abuse, narrating the lives of women through their pain and struggle, companionship and growth, resilience and bravery. Deeply compassionate and beautifully imagined, Alice Walker's epic carries readers on a spirit-affirming journey towards redemption and love.
