                    War and revolution have left the world unrecognisable. Great Britain, now known as Airstrip One, is
                    ruled by the Party, led by Big Brother. Mass surveillance is everything and The Thought Police
                    ensure no individual thinking is allowed. Winston Smith works at The Ministry of Truth, carefully
                    rewriting history.

                    A powerful cultural touchstone of modern American literature, The Color Purple depicts the lives of
                    African American women in early twentieth-century rural Georgia. Separated as girls, sisters Celie
                    and Nettie sustain their loyalty to and hope in each other across time, distance and silence.
                    Through a series of letters spanning twenty years, first from Celie to God, then the sisters to each
                    other despite the unknown, the novel draws readers into its rich and memorable portrayals of Celie,
                    Nettie, Shug Avery and Sofia and their experience. The Color Purple broke the silence around
                    domestic and sexual abuse, narrating the lives of women through their pain and struggle,
                    companionship and growth, resilience and bravery. Deeply compassionate and beautifully imagined,
                    Alice Walker's epic carries readers on a spirit-affirming journey towards redemption and love.

                    The Pain Of Being Human by EUGENE KENNEDY

                    "There is a kind of pain in life," writes Eugene Kennedy, "that has nothing to do with sickness or
                    our sometime savagery. It is the suffering of healthy persons, as undramatic as it is inevitable, as
                    commonplace as it is uncomforted. It is the pain with a thousand private faces, the pain that comes
                    from just being human."
                    In more than 60 insightful meditations, Kennedy helps us to better understand our human condition,
                    and to live with humor, compassion, and purpose. His book is not a cure for our loneliness or doubt
                    or the thousand other pains that come with being alive, but it can get us through a bad day - even
                    bad weeks - and help us to help others do the same.</p>

                    There were three things Liv never wanted to be; starving, filthy, and alone. When an unexpected and
                    inexplicable black out thrusts the world into chaos, that’s exactly how she finds herself. Running
                    for her life, Liv falls at the feet of an unwilling savior. With a shack, a farm, and a lifetime of
                    survival skills, Joshua is the perfect companion for the apocalypse. If only he wanted
                    companionship.
                    It’s hard to earn his trust and even harder to keep it. At a glance he seems to be nothing more than
                    an off-kilter backwoods prepper with a grudge against humanity, but the longer she looks, the more
                    Liv begins to see the man behind the churlish words and unkempt beard.

                    tasked with ruling an inhospitable world where the only thing of value is the “spice” melange, a

                    melange is a prize worth killing for...

                    toward a destiny greater than he could ever have imagined. And as he evolves into the mysterious man

                    All that is left of humanity is on a thousand-year journey to a new planet aboard one ship, The
                    Noah, which is also carrying a dangerous serial killer....
                    As a city planner on the Noah, Hana Dempsey is a gifted psychic, economist, hacker, and bureaucrat
                    and is considered "mission critical". She is non-replaceable, important, essential, but after
                    serving her mandatory Breeding Duty, the impregnation and birthing that all women are obligated to
                    undergo, her life loses purpose as she privately mourns the child she will never be permitted to
                    know.
                    When Policeman Leonard Barrens enlists her and her hacking skills in the unofficial investigation of
                    his mentor's violent death, Dempsey finds herself increasingly captivated by both the case and
                    Barrens himself. According to Information Security, the missing man has simply "Retired", nothing
                    unusual. Together they follow the trail left by the mutilated remains. Their investigation takes
                    them through lost dataspaces and deep into the uninhabited regions of the ship, where they discover
                    that the answer may not be as simple as a serial killer after all.
                    What they do with that answer will determine the fate of all humanity in David Ramirez's thrilling
                    pause resister.</p>

                    Beauty is a Wound by EKA KURNIAWAN

                <p>
                    Beauty Is a Wound combines history, satire, family tragedy, legend, humor, and romance in a sweeping
                    polyphony. The beautiful Indo prostitute Dewi Ayu and her four daughters are beset by incest,
                    murder, bestiality, rape, insanity, monstrosity, and the often vengeful undead. Kurniawan's
                    gleefully grotesque hyperbole functions as a scathing critique of his young nation's troubled past:
                    the rapacious offhand greed of colonialism; the chaotic struggle for independence; the 1965 mass
                    murders of perhaps a million "Communists," followed by three decades of Suharto's despotic rule.
                    Beauty Is a Wound astonishes from its opening line: "One afternoon on a weekend in May, Dewi Ayu
                    rose from her grave after being dead for twenty-one years…" Drawing on local sources—folk tales and
                    the all-night shadow puppet plays, with their bawdy wit and epic scope—and inspired by Melville and
                    Gogol, Kurniawan's distinctive voice brings something luscious yet astringent to contemporary
                    literature.</p>
